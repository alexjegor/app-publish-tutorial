# Membership

There are two basic options available for anyone who wants to develop and distribute their apps:

* Simple Apple Developer Program
* Enterprise Apple Developer Program

## Simple Program
If you're interested in creating apps for distribution on the App Store, join the Apple Developer Program. Membership includes access to beta OS releases, advanced app capabilities, and tools needed to develop, test, and distribute apps.
* Individuals or sole proprietors/single person businesses. Apps are listed under the developer's personal name. 
* Organizations. Apps are listed under the organization's legal entity name. Companies and educational institutions must provide a D-U-N-S Number (available for free) registered to their legal entity during the enrollment process.

> Price: **99 USD** per membership year

## Enterprise Program
With Enterprise account you will still be able to work exactly like how you process for app development. But, Under enterprise account you will not be asked for application review. Using Enterprise account you will be generating InHouse certificates and provisioning profiles and using it you can distribute your app within your organization and you will not get portal to download app like AppStore. You need to create or expose link from there user can download app.
