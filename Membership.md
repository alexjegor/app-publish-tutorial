# Membership

There are two basic options available for anyone who wants to develop and distribute their apps.

## Simple Apple Developer Program
If you're interested in creating apps for distribution on the App Store, join the Apple Developer Program. Membership includes access to beta OS releases, advanced app capabilities, and tools needed to develop, test, and distribute apps.
* Individuals or sole proprietors/single person businesses. Apps are listed under the developer's personal name. 
* Organizations. Apps are listed under the organization's legal entity name. Companies and educational institutions must provide a D-U-N-S Number (available for free) registered to their legal entity during the enrollment process.

> Price: **99 USD** per membership year

## Enterprise Apple Developer Program
The Apple Developer Enterprise Program allows large organizations to develop and deploy proprietary, internal-use apps to their employees. This program is for specific use cases that require private distribution directly to employees using secure internal systems or through a Mobile Device Management solution.
